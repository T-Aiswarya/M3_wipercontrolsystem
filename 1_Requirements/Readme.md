# REQUIREMENTS

# INTRODUCTION
The speed of a wiper is controlled by a wiper speed control system in accordance with frequencies. The pulse signal is digitally processed to provide a control signal. A wiper driver circuit receives the control signal and adjusts the operational speed or timing in line with it.

## SOFTWARE USED
STM32 CUBE IDE

# SWOT ANALYSIS
# Strength:
  1.Cost efficient
   2.Easy Installation
    3.Manually and automatically operated.
# Weakness:
  1.Any failure in the system leads to difficulties during waterfall.
   2.Range is limited
# Opportunities:
  1. Cleans the windscreen
   2. It can be developed into a product.
# Threats:
  1.Noise is produced as it has a mechanical drive system for cleaning.
   2. Clearly to be monitored.
  
# 4W's and 1'H
# Who
Wiper system in the car
# What
To bulid a Wiper system with different speed modes of high realibiity that used in rain conditions
# When
When in Rain Conditions and also to clear the dust in Windscreen
# Where
This can be applied any any type of car as it is very important also in buses and lorries with differnt operations
# How
By displaying and liting the LED in STM32F40 as a model that potraying the working of wiper system
